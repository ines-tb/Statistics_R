* VARIABLES WHICH PROVIDE NON-RANDOM AMOUNT OF VARIANCE TO THE MPG:
Given the results of the multilinear regression we can state that both vehicle length and 
ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the mpg.
This is because, as we can see in column (Pr(>|t|), their values are < than our 
significance level of 0.05%.
Furthermore, the fact that the (Pr(>|t|) value of the intercept is also < 0.05 means that there 
are other variables which have an impact on the mpg. As all variables from out data set have been 
included in the model, it suggests that additional data is advised to be collected for further 
analysis.


* SLOPE:
Having in mind that for multilinear regression models we consider:
H0: The slope of the linear model is zero, or m = 0
Ha: The slope of the linear model is not zero, or m ≠ 0

The p-value of our linear regression analysis is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed
significance level of 0.05%. Therefore, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject our 
null hypothesis. This means that the slope of our multilinear model is not zero.


* PREDICTION EFFECTIVENESS:
Having a value of Multiple R-squared = 0.7149, we can state that a little over 71% of all mpg predicted
values will be correct when using this model. Therefore, we can be confidence that almost three quarters of 
the predicted values will be accurate.



***********************************
***   SUSPENSION COIL SUMMARY   ***
***********************************

* FINDINGS:
The coilSummary table built shows how three lots have almost equal mean and median but the variance and then 
standard deviation specially in Lot 3 completely mismatches. Even the second lot variance is already around ten 
times the first but the third is 220 in comparison. This means each lot had a higher variance than previous, 
rising uncontrollably on the third lot. So any variation produced on the latter had an extreme impact.

For the above reason, the current manufacturing does not meet the design specifications that the suspension 
coils must not exceed 100 pounds per inch, as third lot more than doubled it.

NOTE: An additional plot shows graphically how both mean and median are almost constant over the lots while 
variance and standard deviation clearly differs.


***********************************
***   SUSPENSION COIL T-TEST    ***
***********************************

Student's T-Test has the hypothesis:
H0: There is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its presumed population mean.
Ha: There is a statistical difference between the observed sample mean and its presumed population mean.

After applying the t-test in R we have obtained the following:
		
		One Sample t-test

		data:  sampleCoil$PSI
		t = 0.14846, df = 29, p-value = 0.883
		alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 1499.531
		95 percent confidence interval:
		 1495.958 1503.663
		sample estimates:
		mean of x 
		 1499.811

CONCLUSION:
The results have produced a p-value of 0.883 so being higher than a significance level of 0.05 so we do not 
have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis so we would state that both means are statistically similar.
Then the suspension coil’s pound-per-inch results are NOT statistically different from the mean population 
results of 1,500 pounds per inch.
NOTE: Several executions have all provided p-values > 0.05.


***********************************
***      OWN STUDY DESIGN       ***
***********************************

METRICS:
These are the considered metrics:
	- Cost. 
	- Fuel efficiency.
	- Color options.
	- Electric Vehicle (EV).
	- Car type.
	- Driver age.
	- 1/4 mile time (qsec).


QUESTION / HYPOTHESIS / STATISTICAL TEST:

- Study 1 (Visualization):
	Q: Have car types any relation to driver age?
	H:  H0: Car type is directly related to the age of the driver.
		Ha: Car type has no relation to the age of the driver.
	T: Layered scatter plot and a line to se id there is a clear relation between car type and driver age.

- Study 2 (Visualization):
	Q: Is there any relation between the color of the car and the driver age?
	H:	H0: There is a direct dependency between color and driver age.
		H0: There is not any dependency between color and driver age.
	T: Scatter plot colored by color variable to see if there is a relation between these two variables
	
- Study 3:
	Q: Can we predict the cost of the car from other variables as qsec, mpg, and driver age?
	H:	H0: Cost of the car is affected by measures of qsec, mpg, and driver age.
		Ha: Cost of the car is NOT affected by measures of qsec, mpg, and driver age.
	T: Multilinear regression test (cost ~ qsec, mpg, and driver age)
	NOTE: Additional scatter and linear model can be plot to better display dependencies

- Study 4:
	Q: Is the fuel efficiency affected by the engine? EV vs not EV.
	H:	H0: The mean of the fuel efficiency is the same for EV and not EV cars.
		Ha: The mean of the fuel efficiency is different for EV and not EV cars.
	T: A pair t-test (group of EVs and not EVs).

- Study 5:
	Q: Is the fuel efficiency constant for all car types?
	H:	H0: The means of all groups are equal. (µ1 = µ2 = … = µn).
		Ha: At least one of the means is different from all other groups.
	T: ANOVA one way


DATA NEEDED TO BE COLLECTED:
For this though analysis data for each mentioned magnitude in metrics paragraph is needed:
car cost, fuel efficiency, color, electric vehicle (T/F), car type (SUV, truck, sedan, sportive, convertible...), driver age and qsec.
A table relating car type, driver age or color can be collected from historical data, as it will only affect depending on the car type 
the new prototype fits in and in future which colors should be opted for better sales.
